## Project Overview

The Iris Species Classification project is a machine learning-based solution that accurately classifies iris flowers into their respective species. It leverages the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in the field of machine learning, containing measurements of four iris flower features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three different species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica). Accurate species identification is crucial for various applications, including horticulture, ecology, and conservation efforts.

## Business Understanding

Accurate identification of iris species is essential for various real-world applications. Misclassification can lead to mismanagement of plant resources and ecological consequences. This project addresses the business problem of iris species misclassification by developing a robust machine learning model capable of accurate classification.

## Data

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, each with four features and a target species label. The dataset is split into training and test sets to train and evaluate the classification model. Data preprocessing steps include standardization and label encoding to prepare the data for model training.

## Methodology

The project follows a structured methodology:
1. Data Preprocessing: Standardization of features and label encoding of target species.
2. Model Selection: Selection of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification.
3. Model Training: Training the KNN model on the training dataset.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluation of the model using various metrics, including ROC AUC, accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and AUC-PR.
5. Model Tuning: Fine-tuning the model using GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters.
6. Model Comparison: Comparison of the KNN model with other machine learning algorithms.
7. Model Deployment: Saving the best KNN model for later use.

## Results

The project's primary outcome is a well-trained KNN model capable of accurately classifying iris species. Model performance is evaluated using multiple metrics, and the best model is selected based on F1 score. The project also provides a comparison of the selected model with other algorithms.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the iris species classification model.
4. Save the best model for later use.
5. Use the provided sample observation script to classify iris species.
